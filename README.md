Project Name: From 3D Gaussian Splatting to 3D Generative Model

Members: Jingxian Li, Zhiran Wang, Naichen Shi

We explore the challenge of generating 3D models from single or sparse-view 2D images, which is crucial for applications in augmented reality and heritage preservation. We reproduce the results from one-step and two-step methodologies ([â€œTriplane Meets Gaussian Splatting"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09147) and ["Large Multi-View Gaussian Model"](https://me.kiui.moe/lgm/)) that use advanced neural architectures and techniques like 3D Gaussian splatting for detailed model generation. We provide a series of evaluations that demonstrate significant advances in generative models that bridge the gap between 2D inputs and 3D outputs, enhancing both the sample efficiency and reconstruction fidelity.
